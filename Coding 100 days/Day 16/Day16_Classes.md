### Classes in Python (In-Depth Explanation)

Classes are one of the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. They allow you to bundle data (attributes) and functionality (methods) together, making your code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain. Letâ€™s break down the concept of classes in detail.

---

## **1. What is a Class?**

A **class** is a user-defined blueprint or prototype for creating objects. Classes define attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that encapsulate behaviors and properties relevant to that object.

### Real-World Analogy:
- A **class** is like a **blueprint** for building a house. You can build many houses (objects) from the same blueprint, and each house can have different features, like color, size, or furniture, but they all share the same basic structure.

### Defining a Class in Python:

```python
class ClassName:
    # Attributes and methods go here
    pass  # Placeholder for an empty class
```

### Example:

```python
class Dog:
    # Class attribute
    species = "Canine"
    
    # Constructor method to initialize object attributes
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Instance attribute

    # Instance method
    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is barking.")
```

In this example:
- `Dog` is a class.
- The class has an attribute `species` shared by all objects of the class.
- The constructor `__init__` initializes object-specific attributes like `name` and `age`.
- The method `bark` is an action that the `Dog` object can perform.

## **2. Components of a Class**

### 3.1 Attributes:
Attributes in a class can be of two types:
- **Class Attributes**: Shared by all instances (objects) of the class. These are defined outside any method, typically right below the class definition.
- **Instance Attributes**: Unique to each instance. These are defined within the constructor `__init__` and use the `self` keyword.

#### Class Attributes Example:
```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canine"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Instance attribute
```

---

## **3. The `self` Parameter**

The `self` parameter in methods refers to the **current instance** of the class. It is used to access the instance attributes and methods of the class.

### Example:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # 'self' refers to the object itself
        self.age = age

    def get_name(self):
        return self.name  # Accesses the instance attribute using 'self'

dog1 = Dog("Rex", 5)
print(dog1.get_name())  # Output: Rex
```

---

## **4. Abstraction**

**Abstraction** is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of the functionality. This can be achieved using **abstract classes**, which cannot be instantiated on their own and are meant to be subclasses.

Python provides `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) from the `abc` module for this purpose.

### Example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * (self.radius ** 2)

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.area())  # Output: 78.5
```

## **5. Class vs Object: Key Differences**

| **Aspect**            | **Class**                                          | **Object**                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | A blueprint for creating objects                   | An instance of a class                        |
| **Existence**          | Only exists as a definition in code                | Exists in memory when instantiated from a class |
| **Example**            | `Car`, `Dog`, `Student`                            | `my_car`, `my_dog`, `student1`                |
