### OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) vs. Procedural Programming

**1. Approach and Structure**  
- **OOP**: Focuses on **objects** that contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions) to operate on that data. The program is organized around these objects and their interactions.
- **Procedural Programming**: Focuses on a **sequence of procedures** or functions. The program is a set of procedures, each performing a task or operation on data.

**2. Data Handling**  
- **OOP**: Data and functions are encapsulated within objects. This means that data is usually private and accessed through methods, providing better control over how data is modified.
- **Procedural Programming**: Data is often passed around as arguments to functions, and it’s generally more exposed, which can lead to less controlled data manipulation.

**3. Modularity**  
- **OOP**: Programs are modular by nature, as objects are self-contained and can be reused across different programs or parts of the application. 
- **Procedural Programming**: Modularity exists, but it is achieved by grouping functions and breaking the program into smaller subroutines. However, there is less inherent reusability compared to OOP.

**4. Reusability**  
- **OOP**: Classes and objects promote **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, which allow code reuse by creating new classes based on existing ones, making it easier to extend functionality.
- **Procedural Programming**: Code reusability is mainly achieved through functions, but there’s no inherent mechanism like inheritance or polymorphism.

**5. Abstraction**  
- **OOP**: Offers abstraction by allowing objects to represent real-world entities and hiding the implementation details. It provides higher-level conceptual models.
- **Procedural Programming**: Offers less abstraction, focusing more on the sequence of tasks. Functions perform tasks without encapsulating data and behavior together.

**6. Maintenance**  
- **OOP**: Easier to maintain and modify because objects can be modified independently of one another. Changes in one part of the program usually don't affect others as much.
- **Procedural Programming**: As the codebase grows, maintaining and modifying the program becomes harder because changes in one function can affect other functions and the data they manipulate.

**7. Examples**  
- **OOP**: Python, Java, C++, Ruby.
- **Procedural Programming**: C, Pascal, early versions of BASIC.

### Summary of Key Differences

| Feature                  | OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)       | Procedural Programming           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Basic Unit**            | Object (with attributes and methods)    | Function (procedure)             |
| **Program Organization**  | Based on objects and classes            | Based on functions               |
| **Data Access**           | Data encapsulated within objects        | Data is passed between functions |
| **Modularity**            | High, due to objects and classes        | Achieved via functions, less inherent |
| **Code Reusability**      | Inheritance, Polymorphism               | Functions                        |
| **Abstraction**           | High, due to objects representing entities | Lower, focuses on task execution |
| **Maintenance**           | Easier, due to encapsulation            | More difficult in large codebases |
| **Examples**              | Python, Java, C++                       | C, Pascal, early BASIC           | 

In conclusion, **OOP** is more suitable for complex and large-scale applications, as it allows better organization, abstraction, and reuse of code. **Procedural programming** is more suited for smaller or linear programs where tasks are completed sequentially.
